<h1>How it can be green</h1>
<hr />

<h2>The whole thing could take place online</h2>

<p>
    The books could be online. This is greener as the books would not need to be on paper (which is wood). 
    <br>
    The questions could also be online. This way the people would not need to travel to the place of the contest. Less traveling would result in less pollution.

<h2>This website is actually my first try to create this greener version</h2>
<p>
    This way, the description is already online. 
    On another page, participants could choose from a list a books according to their age group. 
    And they could also download the books from there. 
    And on another page they could be asked questions about each book they read.
    <br>
    This would also be good because we wouldn't need multiple copies of the same book for more than one participant to read it.
