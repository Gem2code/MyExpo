<h1>How it works</h1>

<p>My expo is a reading competition where the participants who would be around the age of 6 to 16 would need to read a lot of books and each age group 
    would have books to choose from. It would take place every September, and it would last 
    for a month. After that month is over every participant would answer the same number of questions about the books they read, to check if they 
    read them. The person who read the most and/or answered most questions right would win a book and a medal, and everyone would get 
    a ‘thank you for joining’ card.
